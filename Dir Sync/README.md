# Python script to Sync 2 Directories
Script takes source argument (directory to sync from) and destination argument (the directory to sync to).
That is, every file snd directory in source directory will copied to destination directory. Would be useful 
to copy all new files generated by test (or CI) to some other directory for later analysis.
The script also take exceptions - file extensions that will not be copied if desired. Sometimes programms
generate .bak or .old files that we do not need to copy to destination directory.
Exempted file extension can be changed/configured by modifying the file_ext_expempt list in main
Script also take optional argument --warning. When provided, the script will no do the actual copy
it will only print messages of which directory and file will be copied  as warning messages.
The other optional argument --debug will make script more verbose
